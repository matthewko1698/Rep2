      Visualizations

      <a href="http://multimedia.scmp.com/2016/southChinaSea/" target="_blank">South China Sea</a>
      <br>
            The first visualization that I want to analyze is by the South China Morning Post.
      This visualization presents the current territorial dispute between many Asian countries in the
      South China sea. Many people know a little about the dispute, especially between more vocal players
      like the Phillipines and China. Most people do not know the whole story, however. This interactive visualization
      helps people understand what countries are involved and how involved they are. The visual is simple and easy to use,
      and the information is based on truthful events that have occured. It is funcitional and simple to use, but it does not
      show how the events have taken place in time and how they have changed throughout the years. It is also
      very visually appealing. In terms of insightfulness, it is not very insightful because others who are knowledgeable
      about the situation can look at a map and visualize the claim dispute themselves. Cairo claims that a good visualization is
      also enlightening, but this visualization is not so enlightening as it is simply informative. It does not expand the shorline of wonder because it does
      not give the reader incentive to continue exploring about the topic.

        <br>
            The second visualization I thought was great is a visualization of the plolitical shifts in the EU. The
        visualization is truthful and is based on the same years for all countries explored. The visualization is functional in
        that it tells a story about the countries backed by the data that the a shift toward the right has occured politcally and has changed over the years.
        The data is presented simply and beautifully and easily shows how the data supports their claim. It is insightful because it is generally difficult
        to quanitify how much political representation has changed over many years in a simple, quantified way. Lastly, it is enlightening because it is helps people
        to understand not only what has happened but gets the reader to wonder why this has occured. This visualization not only
        expands the island of knowledge but it expands the shorline of wonder because this data is only part of the story. This interactive, at least to me, encourages the reader to
        look into the situation more deeply, figuring out why people decided to think this way or what event caused a change in mindset. Because this is critical to many
        different political events, such as Brexit, it is very important to understand. This understanding can also be compared to other parts of the world,
        like the United States, where similar events have occured.
